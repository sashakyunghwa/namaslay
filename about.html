        <p style="text-indent: 60px">I created a memory match game with a yoga theme, called "Namaslay", a reference to slaying the game when you do yoga. Yoga is a passion and hobby of mine, which made creating this game double the fun! It's a game with 18 cards faced down and the player has to try and match all 9 pairs by remembering the position of the cards. Once the player has matched 2 cards they will be displayed face up until all pairs have been matched. Once all 9 pairs have been matched, the user will be displayed a message that they have won the game. As the user clicks through the cards, status will be kept letting the user know how many attempts and the accuracy of their choices.</p>
